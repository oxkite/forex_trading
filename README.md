## Introduction

EA31337 is an open-source automated trading system written in MQL.

## About the project

It is an expert advisor (EA) for algorithmic and automated trading on the Forex
markets.

The project aims to implement various technical analysis strategies and custom
indicators for building trading systems.

It provides a framework to develop, test, and automate trading strategies.

It uses features of MetaTrader 4 and 5 such as the built-in MQL programming
language, backtesting, optimization, and automation for running trading robots.

EA31337 is highly customizable and editable so traders can experiment with
different combinations of technical indicators, risk management rules, money
management plans, etc.

It is an ongoing open-source project on GitHub allowing community contributions
and enhancements from coders and traders.

The source code is compatible with MQL4 and MQL5 and can run on MetaTrader 4
and 5.

So in summary, it is free middleware for building and executing automated
algorithmic trading systems on Metatrader platform without needing to code
everything from scratch. It is popular among retail traders and coding
enthusiasts for researching and deploying automated forex trading strategies.

## Important Considerations Before Use

This open-source project is freely available for education and research
purposes.

While EA algorithm aims to detect optimal market conditions for entries, no
automated process can be perfect or account for evolving future conditions.

We strongly recommend taking time to backtest thoroughly first across different
scenarios, and demo trade for several weeks (do not rush), to deeply understand
understand functionality and performance before risking any capital. Caution is
advised when forward testing or going live, as past results are no guarantee of
future performance.

Trading performance can vary substantially based on the selection of trading
instruments, account funding and leverage, brokerage conditions, account type,
prevailing spreads, and overall market volatility.

Therefore realistic expectations are important. If you are looking for
guaranteed, quick returns without effort, this project is not for you - and
you are unlikely to find that anywhere.

To utilize this project efficiently, some investment of time is required to
fully understand the logic, strategies, and customization options. Thoughtful
effort spent learning can provide the knowledge to employ it successfully as
part of a wise trading approach.

There are no "magic button" solutions in trading. However, with sensible
goals, hard work educating yourself, and risk management awareness - tools
like this can assist skilled traders in developing their own methodologies.
We invite you to explore the possibilities through self-directed research and
simulated testing.

Ongoing development continues to enhance EA's logic across long time
horizons, but no automated system can be perfect or complete. There are
always improvements to make and market dynamics shift over time.

Time invested understanding this tool can provide the knowledge to combine
validated concepts with your own evolving methodology when deploying for live
trading.

The most successful traders put in significant work to educate themselves on
using tools like this properly. Testing and learning never stops. Technical
skills, risk management, and realistic expectations are key.

Effort and wisdom in application can aid skilled traders in combining
validated concepts with their own evolving strategies.

We aim to provide transparency and support education, and not to promise easy
profits.

The work required is up to the individual - as is the responsibility for
results.

It is up to traders to apply, analyze, backtest, refine, and automate their
own defined strategies.

We simply provide this project in good faith to support experienced traders
on their ongoing journeys.

### Key Best Practices

Please read these recommended guidelines:

- Invest time in understanding functionality before use.
  [Test thoroughly](#testing).
- Demo trade any new configuration for weeks before going live.
- Rigorously backtest parameter changes prior to committing capital.
- Choose a broker with steady, low spreads and no trade interventions.
- Start small to evaluate performance holistically, then size wisely.
- Closely monitor account with spreads above 2 pip spreads or high volatility.
- Use a broker permitting micro lots and hedged positions.
- Beware spreads widening and high volatility during Forex news events.
- Run on a VPS (Virtual Private Server) for reliable 24/7 operation.
- Ensure a stable, high-quality internet connection with low latency.
  Slow network or short disruptions may significantly impact the performance.
- Allow auto-position sizing to organically increase with account growth.
- Stick to major and liquid symbols (e.g. EURUSD, EURGBP).
- Do not increase any lot size or risk criteria if your tradings are going well.
- While running on live, keep monitoring your account (e.g. for any
  warnings/errors in the logs).
- Stay patient for opportunities matching strategy conditions.

## Documentation and usage

Documentation can be found at the [wiki page][gh-wiki].

### Customization

The default parameters are optimized for EURUSD symbol pair. However, there are
many adjustable inputs allowing customization across symbols.

These configuration options are documented on [Input parameters wiki
page][gh-wiki-inputs]. Modifications can optimize performance for alternate
currency pairs when rigorously backtested.

We strongly advise thorough demo testing or backtesting before attempting live
trading with new settings. Each symbol and broker combination can behave
differently. Optimize parameter changes carefully based on evidence from
extensive simulations across diverse market conditions.

Live execution should only be considered once the risk-adjusted profile proves
robust during demo trading or backtesting. Please trade live at your own risk,
only with full confidence in the strategy's integrity across settings,
brokers, and pairs based on your own rigorous testing.

### SET files

The SET files represent the best performing input values found during
pre-release optimization testing.

The EA ships already with optimized parameter files tailored specifically for
EURUSD trading. These SET files represent the best performing input values
found during pre-release optimization testing.

Each release could have slightly different parameters, so don't mix old SET
files between different releases.

Please use the SET files included with your downloaded release package rather
than older versions. Optimization is performed before major updates, so
parameters evolve across releases to adapt to changing market dynamics.

## Key Capabilities

This expert advisor provides a wide range of integrated trading functionality:

- Numerous Strategies: Choose from dozens of pre-built algorithmic trading
  strategies across various timeframes and technical indicators.
- Risk Controls: Configure price and trade stop limits along with customizable
  filters for opening or closing trades based on market conditions.
- Tunable Parameters: Fine-tune behaviors by adjusting dozens of input settings
  for elements like risk limits, position sizing, indicators, and more.

### Filtering System

The unique filtering system offers precise control over trade entry and exit
timing. Filters can be configured around account metrics, chart data, market
volatility, active orders, indicators like Moving Averages or RSI, and more.

You are free to customize these filters using Advanced version of EA.

### Risk Management

Intelligent trade management utilizes indicators and rules to determine ideal
times to take profits or close losing positions. The dynamic price stop system
aids risk mitigation in rapidly moving markets.

### Strategies

Each EA's strategy includes self-contained algorithms that analyze the markets
using popular technical indicators across multiple timeframes. Traders can
mix-and-match strategies or code custom logic taking advantage of included
functions and events.

You are free to write your own custom strategies.

### Timeframe

For the trading purposes, any timeframe can be used since EA reads data from
multiple timeframes independently from the current chart.

## Testing

### Backtesting & optimization

It is recommended to use MetaTrader 5 platform for backtesting and optimization.

Backtesting is the process of evaluating a trading strategy by applying it to
historical market data. It allows traders to simulate how a strategy might have
performed in the past across many market conditions.

Optimization takes this one step further by systematically tweaking a
strategy's parameters to determine which configurations may have produced the
best historical results. The goal is to fine-tune inputs related to elements
like risk, position sizing and strategy params to maximize a given performance
metric.

By combining an automated strategy with backtesting and optimization, traders
can rigorously analyze huge amounts of market data efficiently. This provides
statistical insights to build conviction in the strategy's edge while finding
optimal inputs without putting capital at risk.

Please be aware that backtesting cannot reliabily simulate the future outcome.

The backtesting for MT4
has been documented at [Backtesting using MT4][gh-wiki-backtest] wiki page.
